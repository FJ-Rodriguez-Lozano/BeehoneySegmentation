# BeehoneySegmentation
BeehoneySegmentation is a collection of images of honeycombs of apis mellifera bees containing capped honey. This repository not only contains images, but also contains the training results of different deep learning algorithms to solve automatic segmentation in capped honey in bee panels. More information can be found in the paper titled: "Capped honey segmentation in honey combs based on deep learning approach".
